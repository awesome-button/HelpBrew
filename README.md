### Page Branding


**IMPORTANT!** 

### Posts & Comments


As we're keeping it relatively simple, we will only be adding minimal functionality.
Simplified, the functionalities to add are:

- Create a post
- Delete a post
- View all posts
- Write a comment on a post
- Delete a comment on a post
- View all comments on a post

### Who posted/commented

For us to differentiate between posters and commenters we attach a username (in this case, email) to each post and each comment. a relationship between users and posts, and a relationship between users and comments.

### External API integrations



### Direct Messaging

It is nice that we can communicate with people in our application but sometimes we might not want to communicate with
absolutely everyone. Wouldn't it be even nicer to be able to speak with someone in private so that you don't bother
everyone else with your messages? we created a functionality for direct messaging another user. 


### Extra features

* Images/file attachments: Users can optionally attach images or files when they post/comment.
* Like/Dislikes.
* Groups: similar to Facebook groups.
* Searching old posts and comments.
* Pagination/Sorting.
